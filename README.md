# AUTH

An exercise on how to set up authentication manually.

Followed the directions provided in Railscast #250 but in **Rails 4.1.6**.

The basic functionality includes:

- A basic framwork of **Posts** with title and body (scaffolded!)
- A **User** table with basic CRUD functionality, with email and password
- A **Session** table that keeps track of users logged in

Users can:

- sign up
- log in
- log out

Only users logged in can edit or destroy posts

Everybody can see list of posts, create new ones or see details of a selected post.
